  description = <<DESCRIPTION
  A map of role assignments to create. The map key is deliberately arbitrary to avoid issues where map keys maybe unknown at plan time.

  - `management_group_name` - The name of the management group to assign the role to.
  - `role_definition_id_or_name` - The ID or name of the role definition to assign to the principal.
  - `principal_id` - The ID of the principal to assign the role to.
  - `description` - (Optional) The description of the role assignment.
  - `skip_service_principal_aad_check` - (Optional) No effect when using AzAPI.
  - `condition` - (Optional) The condition which will be used to scope the role assignment.
  - `condition_version` - (Optional) The version of the condition syntax. Leave as `null` if you are not using a condition, if you are then valid values are '2.0'.
  - `delegated_managed_identity_resource_id` - (Optional) The delegated Azure Resource Id which contains a Managed Identity. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. This field is only used in cross-tenant scenario.
  - `principal_type` - (Optional) The type of the `principal_id`. Possible values are `User`, `Group` and `ServicePrincipal`. It is necessary to explicitly set this attribute when creating role assignments if the principal creating the assignment is constrained by ABAC rules that filters on the PrincipalType attribute.

variable "role_assignment_definition_lookup_enabled" {
  type        = bool
  description = <<DESCRIPTION
A control to disable the lookup of role definitions when creating role assignments.
If you disable this then all role assignments must be supplied with a `role_definition_id_or_name` that is a valid role definition ID.
