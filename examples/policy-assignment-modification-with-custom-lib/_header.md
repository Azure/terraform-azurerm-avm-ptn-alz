# Policy Assignment Modification with Custom Lib

This example demonstrates some common patterns:

- Deploying a custom management group hierarchy defined by an architecture definition file in the local library
- The use of a custom library, with an archetype override and additional policy assignment
- Modification of a policy assignment to supply new parameters to an assigned policy
