# Deploying the ALZ Reference Architecture with a Dynamic Configuration File

This example shows how to deploy the ALZ reference architecture from a dynamic YAML configuration file.
It uses the ALZ management module to deploy the Log Analytics workspace and Automation Account.
It then uses a YAML file to define the hierarchy.

See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-alz/blob/main/examples/alzreference/main.tf) for more information.
